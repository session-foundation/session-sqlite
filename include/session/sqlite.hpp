// BLOB data directly.  Note that this view remains only value while the statement remains active,
// and so it must be used as needed immediately.

// Note that the lifetime limitation above means that this is *unsuitable* for one-shot methods like
// `prepared_get/prepared_maybe_get` as they finalize the statement before returning the value.

// to the prepared_exec and similar functions.

/// password with a random salt through many thousands of rounds of hashing to make the final key
/// derivation costly to compute when used correctly with a random salt.
///
/// In practice, though, PBKDF2 is of questionable usefulness today.  It was standardized in 2000,
/// when an "attacker" was just someone with more CPUs (which wasn't that easy: this predates even
/// the first commercial dual core CPU), and the performance difference between a low-end CPU and
/// high-end CPU was maybe 5x.  Cracking a password would require lots of expensive CPUs running in
/// parallel: your quarter of a second (or whatever) of CPU time for the legitimate password would
/// have to be incurred on an attacker's CPUs for each guess of the password.  That is no longer the
/// reality today: the adversary is not running a CPU, they are running on GPUs that can compute
/// many thousands of PBKDF2 iterations in parallel at once on a single GPU, essentially meaning the
/// cracking device is thousands (or more) times more powerful, and can readily access GPU clusters
/// that can easily and cheaply compute millions of PBKDF2 hashes in the time your mobile CPU can
/// compute one.
///
/// The only way you can regain some security is by making your own life worse: cranking up the
/// number of iterations so high that you have a very noticeable, battery-burning, CPU fan spin up
/// to compute it so that it's still hopefully a little bit expensive still on the GPU cluster than
/// runs millions of times faster than your device, and just hope that someone doesn't want your
/// password too badly.
///
/// Argon2 was invented to help alleviate this problem: it is deliberately designed to not scale
/// well on GPUs by being a memory-hard algorithm, with memory requirements per hash that are not a
/// big deal on CPUs but are much, much higher than the thread-to-memory ratio of modern GPU
/// clusters.
///
/// And so, if you must use a user-provided plaintext password for encryption, roll your own salted
/// Argon2id hash with parameters suitable for your device and user tolerances and provide the
/// result as a raw key when opening the database, or use the argon2id_password wrapper provided
/// here. This will work with *any* of the encryption algorithms in raw key mode.
///
/// As for AEGIS256: it correctly uses Argon2id by default, but you are still recommended to
/// calculate it yourself (even with AEGIS256 defaults, if you want them) so that additional
/// connections needed for simultaneous thread access can avoid the hash recomputation.
///

/// Database connection managing class.  This class operates as a sort of thread-safe SQLite3
/// connection pool where each thread gets its own connection as needed so that multiple threads do
/// not block each other's queries.
///
/// Effectively you should create one single Database instance (typically constructed very early in
/// the application and destroyed very late--the Database must outlive all Connections it spawns),
/// and then use that instance to obtain a database Connection (by calling `.conn()`) whenever you
/// need to use the database.  `conn()` will:
/// - check to see if your thread already has a "checked out" connection, and if so returns a
///   Connection object that shares ownership of the underlying sqlite3 connection with it.
/// - otherwise, if there is a currently available connection in the pool, returns it to you.
/// - otherwise, makes a new connection to the database and returns that.
///
/// The returned Connection object is RAII: when you release it (or when *all* holders of a thread
/// release it, if shared) the Connection object is reinserted into the pool to be available for the
/// next conn() call.
///
/// Each Connection should only be used in a single thread, and is *not thread safe*.  If you need
/// to do things from different threads, simply obtain a Connection from each one.
///
/// The Database connection class always establishes a single connection on construction, to ensure
/// that the database can be successfully opened and decrypted and whatnot.  That connection is
/// immediately added to the connection pool after initial setup.  If you never use a connection
/// from two different threads at the same time, this is the only connection that your application
/// will ever use.
///
/// One note about connections: the Connection object that you obtain by calling `conn()` shared
/// states with any other Connection objects currently obtained by the same thread: i.e. if f() gets
/// a Connection and, while holding that connection (or even in the middle of querying it) calls g()
/// which gets another Connection, both of those connections are the same underlying sqlite
/// connection -- for instance if there is a transaction open in f() then g() is operating in that
/// same transaction.
///
/// If you absolutely want a new connection even if the same thread already has a connection then
/// instead of `conn()` you can call `unique_conn()`: this will give you a connection that is not
/// currently in use, and will not use that connection for any conn() call (until you release it by
/// allowing the Connection object to go out of scope).
///
/// To repeat something said earlier: a single Connection instance must not be used from multiple
/// threads!  There are debug-build assertions to guard against this, but you should be embarrassed
/// if you ever hit one.
///
/// The actual Connection object is non-copyable, but is lightweight and move constructible.
///
/// Each connection also maintains its own cache of re-entrant safe prepared statements which
/// drastically reduce query processing overhead and should be used for most queries (one exception
/// is when a query is known to be run only once, such as initial one-time schema creations/updates.
/// (Re-entrant safe here means that that if you call `SELECT x FROM y WHERE z = ?` from function f,
/// and during processing of this statement you call some other code that happens to invoke the same
/// query for whatever reason, the cache will *not* use the in-use statement [which would be
/// catastrophic] and instead will generate a second cached statement to be used.  That is: each
/// statement can be cached more than once if your code actually needs more than one active at the
/// same time).
